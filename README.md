# Library Management System

## Project Overview
A Java-based library management system that handles book cataloging, member management, and borrowing operations with persistent data storage.

## Project Status
🚧 **Under Development** - Core features are being implemented

## Technologies Used
- Java
- ArrayList & HashMap data structures
- File I/O operations
- Serialization for persistent storage

## Planned Features

### Book Management
- Book class with attributes:
  - Title
  - Author
  - ISBN
  - Availability status
- Book catalog management
- Search functionality for books

### Member Management
- Member class with attributes:
  - Member ID
  - Name
  - List of borrowed books
- Member registration and tracking

### Library Operations
- Checkout system
- Return system
- Availability tracking
- Borrowing history

### Data Persistence
- Save/Load book catalog to/from files
- Save/Load member data to/from files
- Serialization for object storage

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Basic understanding of Java collections
- Familiarity with file I/O concepts

## Installation & Setup
> Setup instructions will be added as the project develops

## Usage
> Usage examples will be provided once core features are implemented

## Data Storage Format
- **Books data:** `books.dat` (serialized objects)
- **Members data:** `members.dat` (serialized objects)

## Learning Objectives
- Practice OOP principles in Java
- Implement data structures (ArrayList, HashMap)
- Work with file I/O and serialization
- Build a complete console application with persistent storage

## Notes
- This is a learning project focusing on core Java concepts
- Data persistence ensures information survives between program runs
- Console-based interface for simplicity

## Next Steps (Development)
- [ ] Implement Library class to manage operations
- [ ] Create FileService for data persistence
- [ ] Build user interface in Main class
- [ ] Add input validation
- [ ] Implement search functionality
- [ ] Add error handling and edge cases
